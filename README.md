This repository will be used to help teach the basics of making a 🍇Game Jam🍇 game using the Unity Game Engine. We will be imitating the gameplay loop of 🧛‍♀️Vampire Survivors🧛‍♀️ to show how to create a fun game quickly using clever game design! We will have the recordings for all of our workshops using this repo on our [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLNSCYPp4AU8wagUDoaecQUfqHTM-BhMf)!

<h3 align="center"> Currently, we have the following features in the game!</h3>
<a align="center">* A playable character with the camera tracking them
\* Enemies (snakes) that are spawned in on the game starting that path towards the player
\* A generic melee attack that can damage
\* An arrow attack that comes from the user that can damage
\* The character looks left or right depending on where the mouse is on the screen
\* The arrow's path is determined by the vector of the player to the mouse
\* An empty animator set for the player character
\* Melee attacks automatically happen (manual version in progress)
\* Script for obstacles that do damage to everything (displayed as a circle)
